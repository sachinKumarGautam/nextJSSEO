              You can place your order for the first time by sharing your valid prescription with our pharmacists. You can simply upload your prescription directly on our app. Our delivery person will check the original prescription at the time of delivery.
              After the first time, LifCare would proactively take care of your medicine needs through reminders and refills based on your doctor's instruction in prescription. Keep us updated about changes in your prescription by sharing the new prescription each time your doctor changes something.
